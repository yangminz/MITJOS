<h1>Lab 5: File system, Spawn and Shell</h1>

<p>
<b>
Handed out Thursday, November 3, 2016<br>
Due Thursday, November 17, 2016<br>
</b>
</p>

<p>实验的代码可以在我的github: <a href="https://github.com/yangminz/MITJOS/tree/lab5">https://github.com/yangminz/MITJOS/tree/lab5</a>上找到，或者可以通过bash一下命令：
</p>

<pre>cd ~
git clone https://github.com/yangminz/MITJOS.git
cd MITJOS
make grade
</pre>

<p>来进行查看。</p>


<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will implement <code>spawn</code>, a library call
that loads and runs on-disk executables.  You will then flesh out your
kernel and library operating system enough to run a shell on the
console.  These features need a file system, and this lab introduces a
simple read/write file system.

</p>

<h3 id="Getting-Started">Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Use Git to fetch the latest version of the course
repository, and then create a local branch called <tt>lab5</tt> based on our
lab5 branch, <tt>origin/lab5</tt>:
</p>
<pre>athena% <kbd>cd ~/6.828/lab</kbd>
athena% <kbd>add git</kbd>
athena% <kbd>git pull</kbd>
Already up-to-date.
athena% <kbd>git checkout -b lab5 origin/lab5</kbd>
Branch lab5 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab5.
Switched to a new branch "lab5"
athena% <kbd>git merge lab4</kbd>
Merge made by recursive.
.....
athena% 
</pre>

<p> The main new component for this part of the lab is the file
system environment, located in the new <tt>fs</tt> directory.  Scan
through all the files in this directory to get a feel for what all is
new.  Also, there are some new file system-related source files in
the <tt>user</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directories,
</p>

<table align="center">
<tbody><tr><td><tt>fs/fs.c</tt></td>
    <td>Code that mainipulates the file system's on-disk structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fs/bc.c</tt></td>
    <td>A simple block cache built on top of our user-level page fault
	 handling facility.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fs/ide.c</tt></td>
	<td>Minimal PIO-based (non-interrupt-driven) IDE driver code.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fs/serv.c</tt></td>
    <td>The file system server that interacts with client environments
	 using file system IPCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>lib/fd.c</tt></td>
    <td>Code that implements the general UNIX-like file descriptor
	 interface.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>lib/file.c</tt></td>
    <td>The driver for on-disk file type, implemented as a file system
	 IPC client.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>lib/console.c</tt></td>
    <td>The driver for console input/output file type.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>lib/spawn.c</tt></td>
    <td>Code skeleton of the <tt>spawn</tt> library call.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>
You should run the pingpong, primes, and forktree test cases from lab
4 again after merging in the new lab 5 code.  You will need to comment
out the <code>ENV_CREATE(fs_fs)</code> line in <tt>kern/init.c</tt>
because <tt>fs/fs.c</tt> tries to do some I/O, which JOS does not allow
yet. 

Similarly, temporarily comment out the call to <code>close_all()</code> in
<tt>lib/exit.c</tt>; this function calls subroutines that you will implement
later in the lab, and therefore will panic if called. 

If your lab 4 code doesn't contain any bugs, the test cases should run
fine.  Don't proceed until they work.  Don't forget to un-comment
these lines when you start Exercise 1.
</p>

<p>
If they don't work, use <kbd> git diff lab4</kbd> to review
all the changes, making sure there isn't any code you wrote for lab4
(or before) missing from lab 5.  Make sure that lab 4 still works.
</p>

<h3 id="Lab-Requirements">Lab Requirements</h3>

<p>
As before, you will need
to do all of the regular exercises described in the lab and <i>at
least one</i> challenge problem.
Additionally, you will
need to write up brief answers to the questions posed in the lab and a
short (e.g., one or two paragraph) description of what you did to
solve your chosen challenge problem.  If you implement more than one
challenge problem, you only need to describe one of them in the
write-up, though of course you are welcome to do more.  Place the
write-up in a file called <tt>answers-lab5.txt</tt> in the top level of
your <tt>lab5</tt> directory before handing in your work.
</p>

<h1>File system preliminaries</h1>

<p> The file system you will work with is much simpler than most "real"
file systems including that of xv6 UNIX, but it is powerful enough to
provide the basic features: creating, reading, writing, and
deleting files organized in a hierarchical directory structure.
</p>

<p> We are (for the moment anyway) developing only a single-user
operating system, which provides protection sufficient to catch bugs
but not to protect multiple mutually suspicious users from each other.
Our file system therefore does not support the UNIX notions of file
ownership or permissions.  Our file system also currently does not
support hard links, symbolic links, time stamps, or special device
files like most UNIX file systems do.
</p>

<h2 id="On-Disk-File-System-Structure">On-Disk File System Structure</h2>

<p>
Most UNIX file systems divide available disk space into two main types
of regions:
<i>inode</i> regions and <i>data</i> regions.
UNIX file systems assign one <i>inode</i> to each file in the file system;
a file's inode holds critical meta-data about the file
such as its <code>stat</code> attributes and pointers to its data blocks.
The data regions are divided into much larger (typically 8KB or more)
<i>data blocks</i>, within which the file system stores
file data and directory meta-data.
Directory entries contain file names and pointers to inodes;
a file is said to be <i>hard-linked</i>
if multiple directory entries in the file system
refer to that file's inode.
Since our file system will not support hard links,
we do not need this level of indirection
and therefore can make a convenient simplification:
our file system will not use inodes at all
and instead will simply store all of a file's (or sub-directory's) meta-data
within the (one and only) directory entry describing that file.

</p><p>
Both files and directories logically consist of a series of data blocks,
which may be scattered throughout the disk
much like the pages of an environment's virtual address space
can be scattered throughout physical memory.
The file system environment hides the details of block layout,
presenting interfaces for reading and writing sequences of bytes at
arbitrary offsets within files.  The file system environment
handles all modifications to directories internally
as a part of performing actions such as file creation and deletion.
Our file system does allow user environments
to <i>read</i> directory meta-data directly
(e.g., with <code>read</code>),
which means that user environments can perform directory scanning operations
themselves (e.g., to implement the <tt>ls</tt> program)
rather than having to rely on additional special calls to the file system.
The disadvantage of this approach to directory scanning,
and the reason most modern UNIX variants discourage it,
is that it makes application programs dependent
on the format of directory meta-data,
making it difficult to change the file system's internal layout
without changing or at least recompiling application programs as well.
</p>

<p></p><h3 id="Sectors-and-Blocks">Sectors and Blocks</h3>

Most disks cannot perform reads and writes at byte granularity and
instead perform reads and writes in units of <i>sectors</i>.
In JOS, sectors are 512 bytes each.
File systems actually allocate and use disk storage in units of <i>blocks</i>.
Be wary of the distinction between the two terms:
<i>sector size</i> is a property of the disk hardware,
whereas <i>block size</i> is an aspect of the operating system using the disk.
A file system's block size must be
a multiple of the sector size of the underlying disk.

<p>
The UNIX xv6 file system uses a block size of 512 bytes,
the same as the sector size of the underlying disk.
Most modern file systems use a larger block size, however,
because storage space has gotten much cheaper
and it is more efficient to manage storage at larger granularities.
Our file system will use a block size of 4096 bytes,
conveniently matching the processor's page size.

</p><h3 id="Superblocks">Superblocks</h3>

<img src="./Lab 5 report_files/disk.png" align="right" alt="Disk layout">

<p>
File systems typically reserve certain disk blocks
at "easy-to-find" locations on the disk
(such as the very start or the very end)
to hold meta-data describing properties of the file system as a whole,
such as the block size, disk size,
any meta-data required to find the root directory,
the time the file system was last mounted,
the time the file system was last checked for errors,
and so on.
These special blocks are called <i>superblocks</i>.

</p><p>
Our file system will have exactly one superblock,
which will always be at block 1 on the disk.
Its layout is defined by <code>struct Super</code> in <tt>inc/fs.h</tt>.
Block 0 is typically reserved to hold boot loaders and partition tables,
so file systems generally do not use the very first disk block.
Many "real" file systems maintain multiple superblocks,
replicated throughout several widely-spaced regions of the disk,
so that if one of them is corrupted
or the disk develops a media error in that region,
the other superblocks can still be found and used to access the file system.

</p><h3 id="File-Meta-data">File Meta-data</h3>

<img src="./Lab 5 report_files/file.png" align="right" alt="File structure">

The layout of the meta-data describing a file in our file system is
described by <code>struct File</code> in <tt>inc/fs.h</tt>.  This
meta-data includes the file's name, size, type (regular file or
directory), and pointers to the blocks comprising the file. As
mentioned above, we do not have inodes, so this meta-data is stored in
a directory entry on disk.  Unlike in most "real" file systems, for
simplicity we will use this one <code>File</code> structure to
represent file meta-data as it appears
<i>both on disk and in memory</i>.
<p></p><p>
The <code>f_direct</code> array in <code>struct File</code> contains space
to store the block numbers
of the first 10 (<code>NDIRECT</code>) blocks of the file,
which we call the file's <i>direct</i> blocks.
For small files up to 10*4096 = 40KB in size,
this means that the block numbers of all of the file's blocks
will fit directly within the <code>File</code> structure itself.
For larger files, however, we need a place
to hold the rest of the file's block numbers.
For any file greater than 40KB in size, therefore,
we allocate an additional disk block, called the file's <i>indirect block</i>,
to hold up to 4096/4 = 1024 additional block numbers.
Our file system therefore allows files to be up to 1034 blocks,
or just over four megabytes, in size.
To support larger files,
"real" file systems typically support
<i>double-</i> and <i>triple-indirect blocks</i> as well.

</p><h3 id="Directories-versus-Regular-Files">Directories versus Regular Files</h3>


A <code>File</code> structure in our file system
can represent either a <i>regular</i> file or a directory;
these two types of "files" are distinguished by the <code>type</code> field
in the <code>File</code> structure.
The file system manages regular files and directory-files
in exactly the same way,
except that it does not interpret the contents of the data blocks
associated with regular files at all,
whereas the file system interprets the contents
of a directory-file as a series of <code>File</code> structures
describing the files and subdirectories within the directory. 

<p></p><p>
The superblock in our file system
contains a <code>File</code> structure
(the <code>root</code> field in <code>struct Super</code>)
that holds the meta-data for the file system's root directory.
The contents of this directory-file
is a sequence of <code>File</code> structures
describing the files and directories located
within the root directory of the file system.
Any subdirectories in the root directory
may in turn contain more <code>File</code> structures
representing sub-subdirectories, and so on.

</p>

<h1>The File System</h1>
 <p>
The goal for this lab is not to have you implement the
entire file system, but for you to implement only certain key
components. In particular, you will be responsible for reading blocks
into the block cache and flushing them back to disk; allocating disk
blocks; mapping file offsets to disk blocks; and implementing read,
write, and open in the IPC interface.  Because you will not be
implementing all of the file system yourself, it is very important
that you familiarize yourself with the provided code and the various
file system interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="Disk-Access">Disk Access</h2>

<p>
The file system environment in our operating system
needs to be able to access the disk,
but we have not yet implemented any disk access functionality in our kernel.
Instead of taking the conventional "monolithic" operating system strategy
of adding an IDE disk driver to the kernel
along with the necessary system calls to allow the file system to access it,
we instead implement the IDE disk driver
as part of the user-level file system environment.
We will still need to modify the kernel slightly,
in order to set things up so that the file system environment
has the privileges it needs to implement disk access itself.

</p><p>
It is easy to implement disk access in user space this way
as long as we rely on polling, "programmed I/O" (PIO)-based disk access
and do not use disk interrupts.
It is possible to implement interrupt-driven device drivers in user mode as well
(the L3 and L4 kernels do this, for example),
but it is more difficult
since the kernel must field device interrupts
and dispatch them to the correct user-mode environment.

</p><p>
The x86 processor uses the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register
to determine whether protected-mode code
is allowed to perform special device I/O instructions
such as the IN and OUT instructions.
Since all of the IDE disk registers we need to access
are located in the x86's I/O space rather than being memory-mapped,
giving "I/O privilege" to the file system environment
is the only thing we need to do
in order to allow the file system to access these registers.
In effect, the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register
provides the kernel with a simple "all-or-nothing" method
of controlling whether user-mode code can access I/O space.
In our case, we want the file system environment
to be able to access I/O space,
but we do not want any other environments
to be able to access I/O space at all.

<p>为什么要给env I/O权限，是因为文件系统环境需要能够自己接触到硬盘。</p>

<p>为什么赋予I/O权限的代码是<code>e-&gt;env_tf.tf_eflags |= FL_IOPL_MASK;</code>呢，是因为在80386手册中关于EFLAGS有写道：</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>8.3.1 I/O Privilege Level</h4>

<p><em><span style="background-color:yellow">Instructions that deal with I/O need to be restricted but also need to be executed by procedures executing at privilege levels other than zero.</span></em> For this reason, the processor uses two bits of the flags register to store the I/O privilege level (IOPL). The IOPL defines the privilege level needed to execute I/O-related instructions.</p>

<p>The following instructions can be executed only if CPL &lt;= IOPL:</p>

<ul>
<li> IN -- Input
</li><li> INS -- Input String
</li><li> OUT -- Output
</li><li> OUTS -- Output String
</li><li> CLI -- Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag
</li><li> STI -- Set Interrupt-Enable
</li></ul>

<p>These instructions are called "sensitive" instructions, because they are sensitive to IOPL.</p>

<p>To use sensitive instructions, a procedure must execute at a privilege level at least as privileged as that specified by the IOPL (CPL &lt;= IOPL). Any attempt by a less privileged procedure to use a sensitive instruction results in a general protection exception.</p>

<p><em><span style="background-color:yellow">Because each task has its own unique copy of the flags register, each task can have a different IOPL.</span></em> A task whose primary function is to perform I/O (a device driver) can benefit from having an IOPL of three, thereby permitting all procedures of the task to perform I/O. Other tasks typically have IOPL set to zero or one, reserving the right to perform I/O instructions for the most privileged procedures.</p>

<p>A task can change IOPL only with the POPF instruction; however, such changes are privileged. No procedure may alter IOPL (the I/O privilege level in the flag register) unless the procedure is executing at privilege level 0. An attempt by a less privileged procedure to alter IOPL does not result in an exception; IOPL simply remains unaltered.</p>

<p>The POPF instruction may be used in addition to CLI and STI to alter the interrupt-enable flag (IF); however, changes to IF by POPF are IOPL-sensitive. A procedure may alter IF with a POPF instruction only when executing at a level that is at least as privileged as IOPL. An attempt by a less privileged procedure to alter IF in this manner does not result in an exception; IF simply remains unaltered.</p>

<p>看到上面引文中的斜体高亮的句子，就可以知道每个IOPL位是修改在每个env备份的flag寄存器上的。</p>

<h2 id="The-Block-Cache">The Block Cache</h2>

<p>
In our file system,
we will implement a simple "buffer cache" (really just a block cache)
with the help of the processor's virtual memory system.
The code for the block cache is in <tt>fs/bc.c</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Our file system will be limited to handling disks of size 3GB or less.
We reserve a large, fixed 3GB region
of the file system environment's address space,
from 0x10000000 (<code>DISKMAP</code>)
up to 0xD0000000 (<code>DISKMAP+DISKMAX</code>),
as a "memory mapped" version of the disk.
For example,
disk block 0 is mapped at virtual address 0x10000000,
disk block 1 is mapped at virtual address 0x10001000,
and so on.  The <code>diskaddr</code> function in <tt>fs/bc.c</tt>
implements this translation from disk block numbers to virtual
addresses (along with some sanity checking).
</p>

<p>
Since our file system environment has its own virtual address space
independent of the virtual address spaces
of all other environments in the system,
and the only thing the file system environment needs to do
is to implement file access,
it is reasonable to reserve most of the file system environment's address space
in this way.
It would be awkward for a real file system implementation
on a 32-bit machine to do this
since modern disks are larger than 3GB.
Such a buffer cache management approach
may still be reasonable on a machine with a 64-bit address space.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it would take a long time to read the entire disk into
memory, so instead we'll implement a form of <i>demand paging</i>,
wherein we only allocate pages in the disk map region and read the
corresponding block from the disk in response to a page fault in this
region.  This way, we can pretend that the entire disk is in memory.
</p>

<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Implement the <code>bc_pgfault</code> and <code>flush_block</code>
functions in <tt>fs/bc.c</tt>.
<code>bc_pgfault</code> is a page fault handler, just like the one
your wrote in the previous lab for copy-on-write fork, except that
its job is to load pages in from the disk in response to a page
fault.  When writing this, keep in mind that (1) <code>addr</code>
may not be aligned to a block boundary and (2) <code>ide_read</code>
operates in sectors, not blocks.
</p><p>
The <code>flush_block</code> function should write a block out to disk
<i>if necessary</i>.  <code>flush_block</code> shouldn't do anything
if the block isn't even in the block cache (that is, the page isn't
mapped) or if it's not dirty.
We will use the VM hardware to keep track of whether a disk
block has been modified since it was last read from or written to disk.
To see whether a block needs writing,
we can just look to see if the <code>PTE_D</code> "dirty" bit
is set in the <code>uvpt</code> entry.
(The <code>PTE_D</code> bit is set by the processor in response to a
write to that page; see 5.2.4.3 in <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/readings/i386/s05_02.htm">chapter
5</a> of the 386 reference manual.)
After writing the block to disk, <code>flush_block</code> should clear
the <code>PTE_D</code> bit using <code>sys_page_map</code>.

<hr width="80%" ,="" color="Gold" size="10">

<p>这一题完全可以根据注释写出，只需要记得用fs/ide.c : ide_read()读取磁盘内容即可：</p>

    if (addr &lt; (void*)DISKMAP || addr &gt;= (void*)(DISKMAP + DISKSIZE))
        panic("page fault in FS: eip %08x, va %08x, err %04x",
              utf-&gt;utf_eip, addr, utf-&gt;utf_err);

    if (super &amp;&amp; blockno &gt;= super-&gt;s_nblocks)
        panic("reading non-existent block %08x\n", blockno);

    // LAB 5: you code here:
    // round addr to page boundary
    addr = ROUNDDOWN(addr, PGSIZE);
    // Allocate a page in the disk map region
    sys_page_alloc(0, addr, PTE_W|PTE_U|PTE_P);
    // Read the contents of the block from the disk 
    if ((r = ide_read(blockno*BLKSECTS, addr, BLKSECTS)) &lt; 0){
        panic("failed to read contents from the disk: %e", r);
    }

    if ((r = sys_page_map(0, addr, 0, addr, uvpt[PGNUM(addr)] &amp; PTE_SYSCALL)) &lt; 0)
        panic("in bc_pgfault, sys_page_map: %e", r);

    if (bitmap &amp;&amp; block_is_free(blockno))
        panic("reading free block %08x\n", blockno);
}
</pre>

<p>按照注释，要对齐addr，然后用lab 4的sys_page_alloc分配页空间，再调用fs/ide.c中的ide_read()将磁盘中的内容读入页空间即可。</p>

<p>关于flush_block()函数，从检查函数check_bc()可以看到，它的形参是磁盘地址。然后根据注释的要求，用va_is_mapped(), va_is_dirty()进行检查：</p>

<pre>void
flush_block(void *addr)
{
    uint32_t blockno = ((uint32_t)addr - DISKMAP) / BLKSIZE;

    if (addr &lt; (void*)DISKMAP || addr &gt;= (void*)(DISKMAP + DISKSIZE))
        panic("flush_block of bad va %08x", addr);

    // LAB 5: Your code here.
    void *blkaddr = ROUNDDOWN(addr, PGSIZE);
    envid_t envid = thisenv-&gt;env_id;
    // If the block is not in the block cache or is not dirty, does nothing.
    if (!va_is_mapped(addr) || !va_is_dirty(addr)){
        return;
    }
    // After writing the block to disk, flush_block should clear the PTE_D bit using sys_page_map
    if (ide_write(blockno * BLKSECTS, blkaddr, BLKSECTS) &lt; 0){
        panic("flush_block: failed to write disk block\n");
    }
    // Use the PTE_SYSCALL constant when calling sys_page_map
    if(sys_page_map(envid, blkaddr, envid, blkaddr, PTE_SYSCALL) &lt; 0){
        panic("flush_block: failed to mark disk page as non dirty\n");
    }
}
</pre>

<p>实际上具体流程在蓝框中的题目里也说的很详细了：先确定如果不在block cache中或是dirty的，就直接返回；否则，根据PTE_D的dirty位确定是否需要写block，写过block之后用sys_page_map清理PTE_D位。</p>

<hr width="80%" ,="" color="Gold" size="10">


The <code>fs_init</code> function in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt> is a prime
example of how to use the block cache.  After initializing the block
cache, it simply stores pointers into the disk map region in the
<code>super</code> global variable.  
After this point, we can simply read from the <code>super</code>
structure as if they were in memory and our page fault handler will
 read them from disk as necessary.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
The block cache has no eviction policy.  Once a block gets faulted in
to it, it never gets removed and will remain in memory forevermore.
Add eviction to the buffer cache.  Using the <code>PTE_A</code>
"accessed" bits in the page tables, which the hardware sets on any
access to a page, you can track approximate usage of
disk blocks without the need to modify every place in the code that
accesses the disk map region.  Be careful with dirty blocks.

<hr width="80%" ,="" color="Gold" size="10">


<h2 id="The-Block-Bitmap">The Block Bitmap</h2>

After <code>fs_init</code> sets the <code>bitmap</code> pointer, we
can treat <code>bitmap</code> as a packed array of bits, one for each
block on the disk.  See, for example, <code>block_is_free</code>,
which simply checks whether a given block is marked free in the
bitmap.

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-3" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div><div id="Exercise-3" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Use <code>free_block</code> as a model to
implement <code>alloc_block</code> in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt>, which should find a
free disk
block in the bitmap, mark it used, and return the number of that
block.
When you allocate a block, you should immediately flush
the changed bitmap block to disk with <code>flush_block</code>, to
help file system consistency.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should now
pass "alloc_block".
</p></div>

<hr width="80%" ,="" color="Gold" size="10">

<p>此题需要遍历bitmap找到其中空闲的disk block，将它标记为used，返还这个block的编号作为被分配出来的block。且需要调用之前写的flush_block()以保持文件系统的一致性。</p>

<p>所以，先看一下bitmap的组织。bitmap的定义在fs/fs.h：</p>

<pre>uint32_t *bitmap;       // bitmap blocks mapped in memory
</pre>

<p>初始化分配内存在fs/fsformat.c：</p>

<pre>    nbitblocks = (nblocks + BLKBITSIZE - 1) / BLKBITSIZE;
    bitmap = alloc(nbitblocks * BLKSIZE);
    memset(bitmap, 0xFF, nbitblocks * BLKSIZE);
</pre>

<p>可见bitmap实际上是一个保存所有block的内存数组。这样一来，如何遍历bitmap也就清楚了：</p>

<pre>int
alloc_block(void)
{
    // LAB 5: Your code here.
    uint32_t i, j;
    // There are super-&gt;s_nblocks blocks in the disk altogether.
    for(i = 0; i &lt; super-&gt;s_nblocks; i++){
        if(block_is_free(i)){
            // use free_block as an example for manipulating the bitmap
            bitmap[i/32] &amp;= ~(1&lt;&lt;(i%32));
            // immediately flush the changed bitmap block to disk
            flush_block(diskaddr(i/BLKBITSIZE + 2));
            // Return block number allocated on success
            return i;
        }
    }
    // panic("alloc_block not implemented");
    return -E_NO_DISK;
}
</pre>

<p>其中要注意的是，将block从free设定为used要仿照fs/fs.c : free_block()进行一些位运算。free_block()是设为free，设为used只需反其道而行之。</p>

Everything below the dotted line is simply the mechanics of getting a
read request from the regular environment to the file system
environment.  Starting at the beginning, <code>read</code> (which we
provide) works on any file descriptor and simply dispatches to the
appropriate device read function, in this case
<code>devfile_read</code> (we can have more device types, like pipes).
 <code>devfile_read</code>
implements <code>read</code> specifically for on-disk files.  This and
the other <code>devfile_*</code> functions in <tt>lib/file.c</tt>
implement the client side of the FS operations and all work in roughly
the same way, bundling up arguments in a request structure, calling
<code>fsipc</code> to send the IPC request, and unpacking and
returning the results.  The <code>fsipc</code> function simply handles
the common details of sending a request to the server and receiving
the reply.
</p>

<p>
The file system server code can be found in <tt>fs/serv.c</tt>.  It
loops in the <code>serve</code> function, endlessly receiving a
request over IPC, dispatching that request to the appropriate handler
function, and sending the result back via IPC.  In the read example,
<code>serve</code> will dispatch to <code>serve_read</code>, which
will take care of the IPC details specific to read requests such as
unpacking the request structure and finally call
<code>file_read</code> to actually perform the file read.
</p>

<p>
Recall that JOS's IPC mechanism lets an environment send a single
32-bit number and, optionally, share a page.  To send a request from
the client to the server, we use the 32-bit number for the request
type (the file system server RPCs are numbered, just like how
syscalls were numbered) and store the arguments to the request in a
<code>union Fsipc</code> on the page shared via the IPC.  On the
client side, we always share the page at <code>fsipcbuf</code>; on the
server side, we map the incoming request page at <code>fsreq</code>
(<code>0x0ffff000</code>).
</p>

<p>
The server also sends the response back via IPC.  We use the 32-bit
number for the function's return code.  For most RPCs, this is all
they return.  <code>FSREQ_READ</code> and <code>FSREQ_STAT</code> also
return data, which they simply write to the page that the client sent
its request on.  There's no need to send this page in the response
IPC, since the client shared it with the file system server in the
first place.  Also, in its response, <code>FSREQ_OPEN</code> shares with
the client a new "Fd page". We'll return to the file descriptor 
page shortly.

<p>IPC在linux中指进程间通信 - Inter-Process Communication。对于常规的env而言，无法直接调用文件系统env中的函数，因此在JOS中通过远程进程调用RPC - Remote Procedure Call来充当IPC，<font color="red"><strong>将文件系统env看做一个server，常规env看做一个client</strong></font>，通过ipc_send, ipc_recv完成(颇类似于socket通信，文件系统server和一般的server一样，出于永不停息的循环之中，不停地收发文件处理信息)，在上面MIT的讲解中有说明。</p>

<p>在这里要实现常规env和文件系统env之间的通信，是文件系统server端的倒数第二环。server_read需要为文件读取提供进程通信RPC的接口。为了实现这个目的，要学习一下fs/serv.c :　serv_set_size()中关于IPC/RPC的使用。</p>

<p>按照fs/serv.c :　serv_set_size()中的套路，要设定一个结构体指针OpenFile *o，将查找到的目标文件的信息放在o中，然后调用fs/fs.c中相关的函数即可：</p>

devfile_write(struct Fd *fd, const void *buf, size_t n)
{
    uint32_t max_n = PGSIZE - (sizeof(int) + sizeof(size_t));
    // Write at most 'n' bytes from 'buf' to 'fd' at the current seek position.
    n = n &gt; max_n ? max_n : n;

    fsipcbuf.write.req_fileid = fd-&gt;fd_file.id;
    fsipcbuf.write.req_n = n;
    // Becareful: fsipcbuf.write.req_buf is only so large, but
    // remember that write is always allowed to write *fewer*

    memmove(fsipcbuf.write.req_buf, buf, n);
    // Make an FSREQ_WRITE request to the file system server
    //   The number of bytes successfully written.

<h1>Spawning Processes</h1>

<p>
We have given you the code for <code>spawn</code> (see <tt>lib/spawn.c</tt>)
<!-- In this exercise you will implement <code>spawn</code>, -->
which creates a new environment,
loads a program image from the file system into it,
and then starts the child environment running this program.
The parent process then continues running independently of the child.
The <code>spawn</code> function effectively acts like a <code>fork</code> in UNIX
followed by an immediate <code>exec</code> in the child process.
</p>
<p>
We implemented <code>spawn</code> rather than a
UNIX-style <code>exec</code> because <code>spawn</code> is easier to
implement from user space in "exokernel fashion", without special help
from the kernel.  Think about what you would have to do in order to
implement <code>exec</code> in user space, and be sure you understand
why it is harder.

<h2 id="Sharing-library-state-across-fork-and-spawn">Sharing library state across fork and spawn</h2>

<p>
The UNIX file descriptors are a general notion that also
encompasses pipes, console I/O, etc.  In JOS, each of these device
types has a corresponding <code>struct Dev</code>, 
with pointers to the functions that implement
read/write/etc. for that device type.  <tt>lib/fd.c</tt> implements the
general UNIX-like file descriptor interface on top of this.  Each
<code>struct Fd</code> indicates its device type, and most of the
functions in <tt>lib/fd.c</tt> simply dispatch operations to functions
in the appropriate <code>struct Dev</code>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>lib/fd.c</tt> also maintains the <i>file descriptor table</i>
region in each application environment's address space, starting at
<code>FDTABLE</code>.  This area reserves a page's worth (4KB) of
address space for each of the up to <code>MAXFD</code> (currently 32)
file descriptors the application can have open at once.  At any given
time, a particular file descriptor table page is mapped if and only if
the corresponding file descriptor is in use.  Each file descriptor
also has an optional "data page" in the region starting at
<code>FILEDATA</code>, which devices can use if they choose.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to share file descriptor state across
  <code>fork</code> and <code>spawn</code>, but file descriptor state is kept
  in user-space memory.  Right now, on <code>fork</code>, the memory
  will be marked copy-on-write,
  so the state will be duplicated rather than shared.
  (This means environments won't be able to seek in files they
  didn't open themselves and that pipes won't work across a fork.)
  On <code>spawn</code>, the memory will be
  left behind, not copied at all.  (Effectively, the spawned environment
  starts with no open file descriptors.)
</p>

<p>
  We will change <code>fork</code> to know that 
  certain regions of memory are used by the "library operating system" and
  should always be shared.  Rather than hard-code a list of regions somewhere,
  we will set an otherwise-unused bit in the page table entries (just like
  we did with the <code>PTE_COW</code> bit in <code>fork</code>).
</p>

<p>
  We have defined a new <code>PTE_SHARE</code> bit
  in <tt>inc/lib.h</tt>.
  This bit is one of the three PTE bits
  that are marked "available for software use"
  in the Intel and AMD manuals.
  We will establish the convention that
  if a page table entry has this bit set,
  the PTE should be copied directly from parent to child
  in both <code>fork</code> and <code>spawn</code>.
  Note that this is different from marking it copy-on-write:
  as described in the first paragraph,
  we want to make sure to <i>share</i>
  updates to the page.
</p>

  <div class="required"><div id="Exercise-8" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div><div id="Exercise-8" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
	<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>

  Change <code>duppage</code> in <tt>lib/fork.c</tt> to follow
  the new convention.  If the page table entry has the <code>PTE_SHARE</code>
  bit set, just copy the mapping directly.
  (You should use <code>PTE_SYSCALL</code>, not <code>0xfff</code>,
  to mask out the relevant bits from the page table entry. <code>0xfff</code>
  picks up the accessed and dirty bits as well.)
  </p>

  <p>
	Likewise, implement <code>copy_shared_pages</code> in
	<tt>lib/spawn.c</tt>.  It should loop through all page table
	entries in the current process (just like <code>fork</code>
	did), copying any page mappings that have the
	<code>PTE_SHARE</code> bit set into the child process.
  </p></div>

<p>
  Use <kbd>make run-testpteshare</kbd> to check that your code is 
  behaving properly.
  You should see lines that say "<tt>fork handles PTE_SHARE right</tt>"
  and "<tt>spawn handles PTE_SHARE right</tt>".
</p>

<p>
  Use <kbd>make run-testfdsharing</kbd> to check that file descriptors are shared
  properly.
  You should see lines that say "<tt>read in child succeeded</tt>" and
  "<tt>read in parent succeeded</tt>".
</p>

<h1>The keyboard interface</h1>

<p>
  For the shell to work, we need a way to type at it.
  QEMU has been displaying output we write to
  the CGA display and the serial port, but so far we've only taken
  input while in the kernel monitor.
  In QEMU, input typed in the graphical window appear as input
  from the keyboard to JOS, while input typed to the console
  appear as characters on the serial port.
  <tt>kern/console.c</tt> already contains the keyboard and serial
  drivers that have been used by the kernel monitor since lab 1,
  but now you need to attach these to the rest
  of the system.
</p>

  <div class="required"><div id="Exercise-9" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div><div id="Exercise-9" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
	<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
  In your <tt>kern/trap.c</tt>, call <code>kbd_intr</code> to handle trap
  <code>IRQ_OFFSET+IRQ_KBD</code> and <code>serial_intr</code> to
  handle trap <code>IRQ_OFFSET+IRQ_SERIAL</code>.
  </p></div>

<p>
  We implemented the console input/output file type for you,
  in <tt>lib/console.c</tt>. <code>kbd_intr</code> and <code>serial_intr</code>
  fill a buffer with the recently read input while the console file
  type drains the buffer (the console file type is used for stdin/stdout by
  default unless the user redirects them).
</p>

<p>
  Test your code by running <kbd>make run-testkbd</kbd> and type
  a few lines.  The system should echo your lines back to you as you finish them.
  Try typing in both the console and the graphical window, if you
  have both available.
</p>

<h1>The Shell</h1>

<p>
  Run <kbd>make run-icode</kbd> or <kbd>make run-icode-nox</kbd>.
  This will run your kernel and start <tt>user/icode</tt>.
  <tt>icode</tt> execs <tt>init</tt>,
  which will set up the console as file descriptors 0 and 1 (standard input and
  standard output).  It will then spawn <tt>sh</tt>, the shell.
  You should be able to run the following
  commands:
</p>
<pre>	echo hello world | cat
	cat lorem |cat
	cat lorem |num
	cat lorem |num |num |num |num |num
	lsfd
</pre>
<p>
  Note that the user library routine <code>cprintf</code>
  prints straight
  to the console, without using the file descriptor code.  This is great
  for debugging but not great for piping into other programs.
  To print output to a particular file descriptor (for example, 1, standard output),
  use <code>fprintf(1, "...", ...)</code>.
  <code>printf("...", ...)</code> is a short-cut for printing to FD 1.
  See <tt>user/lsfd.c</tt> for examples.
</p>

	<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>

 </p><p>The shell doesn't support I/O redirection.  It would be nice to run
	<kbd>sh &lt;script</kbd> instead of having to type in all the
	commands in the script by hand, as you did above.  Add
I/O redirection for &lt;  to  <code>user/sh.c</code>.</p>
<p>Test your implementation by typing <kbd>sh &lt;script</kbd> into
your shell<p.>

</p.></p><p>
  Run <kbd>make run-testshell</kbd> to test your shell.
  <tt>testshell</tt> simply feeds the above commands (also found in
  <tt>fs/testshell.sh</tt>) into the shell and then checks that the
  output matches <tt>fs/testshell.key</tt>. 
</p>

  <p></p></div>


<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>  Add more features to the
